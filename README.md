# This react Daraz clone is built with Vite
# I've used some react hooks, react-slick-slider, font awesome, react-routers and some other packages in here which made the site look good & feel good while using it.
## The navigation feels very smooth as because of react router dom the site doesn't actually reload, it just changes some components which are necessary.
## I wrote most of the functions in App.jsx and then sent them down to childrens as props and used them in the components.
## To run this project you need to clone the repo then install dependencies then run "npm run dev" as vite has added a script stating dev builtin there.
## Interviewers actually asked me to use Tailwind css but I know very basics of tailwind css and wasn't confident enough to use it in such a big project that's why I just did it in vanilla css which was a mistake actually.
### I'll brush up my tailwind css skills then try the same project with tailwind css once again.
# You can check the site live here - 
# https://react-daraz-clone.netlify.app/
## I've deployed the site on netlify, isn't my best work here but it is decent considering I took a long break from react, I was focusing more on my problem solving skills which was helpful in this project as well actually.
