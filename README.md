# Daraz Clone

## This Daraz clone e-commerce site is built with Vite and ReactJS.

I've used some react hooks, react-slick-slider, font awesome, react-routers, react hot toast and some other packages in here which made the site look good & feel good while using it.

## You can check the site live here -

The navigation feels very smooth because of react router dom, the site doesn't actually reload, it just changes some components which are necessary and stated inside by me.
I wrote most of the functions in App.jsx and then sent them down to child components as props and used them in the components.

## Running locally - 

To run this project locally you'll need to clone the repo then install dependencies using 

```
$ npm install
# or
$ yarn install
``` 

then run 

```
$ npm run dev
# or
$ yarn dev
``` 

as vite has added a script stating dev builtin here it'll execute the script and start the dev server on - http://localhost:5173/.
