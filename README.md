# This E-commerce site is built with Vite and ReactJS.

I've used some react hooks, react-slick-slider, font awesome, react-routers and some other packages in here which made the site look good & feel good while using it.

# You can check the site live here -

## Overview of the app -

## The navigation feels very smooth because of react router dom, the site doesn't actually reload, it just changes some components which are necessary and stated inside by me.
## I wrote most of the functions in App.jsx and then sent them down to child components as props and used them in the components.
## To run this project you need to clone the repo then install dependencies using "npm install" then run "npm run dev" as vite has added a script stating dev builtin here.
### Interviewers actually asked me to use Tailwind css but I know very basics of tailwind css and wasn't confident enough to use it in such a big project that's why I just did it in vanilla css which was a mistake actually because even basics of tailwind would've been better here I understood this later on as the project grew.
### I'll brush up my tailwind css skills then try the same project with tailwind css once again after a few days. Good project overall had fun trying to do it.
### I've deployed the site on netlify, isn't my best work here but it is decent considering I took a long break from react, I was focusing more on my problem solving skills which was helpful in this project as well but needed more tailwind/ui kit knowledge to make a project of this caliber this fast.
