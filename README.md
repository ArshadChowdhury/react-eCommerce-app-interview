# This react Daraz clone is built with vite
## To run this project you need to download the zip file then install dependencies then run "npm run dev" as vite has added a script stating dev builtin there.
## Interviewers actually asked me to use Tailwind css but I know very basics of tailwind css and wasn't confident enough to use it in such a big project that's why I just did it in vanilla css which was a mistake actually.
### I'll brush up my tailwind css skills then try the same project with tailwind css once again.
